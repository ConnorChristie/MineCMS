#MincCMS
##What is MineCMS?
MineCMS aims at providing an interface for general users (There's a tonne of admin sites on here already). It will include:
* Forums / Social Network
* A homepage with blog and server information
* Full integration with your server.

##Why is this better than phpBB, Wordpress etc?
For a start, it will look like a Minecraft site right from the start. No searching through massive databases of themes to find something suitable. Your sites will look more professional because the style will be consistent across the forums, homepage and blog.
The biggest point is that it will be a forum/blog/information site all in one. You don't need to worry about setting up 2 or 3 different CMSs or hacking together a giant, unstable hybrid. This can come in handy for users with basic web hosting packages with limited databases etc. The forums will be built to make socializing with other players easy and fun. Full profile pages featuring stats, photos and anything else you want to add.
Everything will be linked to your server by use of a plugin. When someone receives a PM on the forums, they will get a message in game, when a new topic is posted there will be an in game announcement. If you're in game, and want to send a message to someone on the forums you can do that to. All of these features can be toggled to suit your liking.

MineCMS will truly be the the ultimate social tool for your server.

##I want to help develop MineCMS!
That's great! I'm going to do most of the coding myself in php. But I'm useless at graphic design etc. If anyone wants to help out by contributing HTML, graphics or even Javascript then feel free to PM me.
We may also have a need for a custom Bukkit plugin, if there's any plugin developers that want to join in. Something to let us manage groups, send messages to players and stuff like that. That will probably come later though, at the moment I plan on using JSONAPI 2.5 by Alec Gorge.

##When will it be available?
The project is still in the planning stage. I'm aiming to get a beta version out for late February. Though this might change depending on how much work it turns out to be.
